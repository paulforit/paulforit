# GreenPeak Landscaping Security Assessment and Compliance Case Study  

## **Scenario**  
**GreenPeak Landscaping** is a mid-sized landscaping company based in Canada. The company provides residential and commercial landscaping services, with operations extending to online consultations and product sales. Their IT department supports in-office operations, field team devices, and an online platform that services customers across Canada and the U.S.  

As GreenPeak has expanded, their IT infrastructure has grown significantly. This includes mobile devices for field staff, IoT-enabled equipment, and an e-commerce platform. However, the CEO has raised concerns about the company's ability to secure sensitive customer data, meet compliance requirements, and prevent operational disruptions.  

To address these concerns, the IT manager initiated an internal audit using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to assess the company's security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with industry regulations like **PCI DSS** and Canadian **PIPEDA** laws.

## **Recommendations**  

To address identified gaps, GreenPeak Landscaping should implement the following:  

1. **Least Privilege Access**: Enforce role-based access controls to restrict employee access to sensitive data.  
2. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Develop and test a disaster recovery and business continuity plan.  
3. **Encryption**: Implement encryption protocols for sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.  
4. **Password Policies**: Update password policies to enforce complexity, uniqueness, and expiration.  
5. **Regular Backups**: Establish a comprehensive backup plan using incremental and full backup schedules.  
6. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Deploy IDS/IPS to monitor and respond to potential network intrusions.  
7. **Compliance Training**: Train employees on regulatory compliance and security best practices.  

By addressing these areas, GreenPeak Landscaping can significantly improve its security posture and ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations.
