## About Me

I am a cybersecurity professional with a strong focus on protecting systems, securing data, and mitigating risks in the ever-evolving digital landscape. With hands-on experience in tools and technologies like Salesforce, HubSpot, and SQL, I have developed expertise in securing CRM systems, automating workflows, and analyzing vulnerabilities to ensure robust security practices.

Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing at Athabasca University, I have further enhanced my knowledge with certifications in cybersecurity, IT support, and network security, enabling me to align technology-driven solutions with organizational goals.

My certifications include Salesforce Certified Administrator (expected 2025), Google Cybersecurity Certificate, and Coursera Specializations in cybersecurity. These qualifications, combined with my practical experience, position me to contribute meaningfully to cybersecurity initiatives focused on risk management, process automation, and data protection.
